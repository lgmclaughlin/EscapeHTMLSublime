Synopsis
========
This is a simple packaged plugin for Sublime Text that will allow one to escape HTML chars (<, >, &, ', and ") quickly by hitting [ctrl + alt + e].

Motivation
==========
While working on a project in which we were putting example HTML snippets on webpages, I had no disire to go through and escape each character by hand for web display. As such, I wrote a quick plugin to do it for me. I figured I'd share it with the world in case it could help someone else as well.

Installation
============
TBD
